I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uic.edu/) at [University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)](https://www.uic.edu/). I lead the Responsible and Reliable AI Lab (R<sup>2</sup> Lab). I received my PhD degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University (ASU) in 2022 advised by Dr. [Huan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dzf46C8AAAAJ&hl=en), M.Eng. degree in Industrial Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnique Institute (RPI), and B.Eng. degree in Industrial Engineering at Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST). My research interests are broadly in data mining and machine learning, with a particular focus on socially responsible AI, causal machine learning, and AI for social good.

<font size="3"> **Prospective students**: I am always actively looking for self-motivated PhD students to conduct research in responsible AI (e.g., fairness, interpretability/explainability, and privacy) and reliable AI (e.g., robustness and uncertainty quantification), causal machine learning, and data mining in general. I'm also happy to work with self-funded masters and undergraduate students. Interested students please email me with your CV and transcript(s). </font>
