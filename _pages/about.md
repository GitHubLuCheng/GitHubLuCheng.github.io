I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uic.edu/) at [University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)](https://www.uic.edu/). I received my PhD degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University (ASU) in 2022 advised by Dr. [Huan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dzf46C8AAAAJ&hl=en), M.Eng. degree in Industrial Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnique Institute (RPI), and B.Eng. degree in Industrial Engineering at Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST). My research interests are broadly in data mining and machine learning, with a particular focus on socially responsible AI, social computing, causal machine learning, and AI for social good.

**Prospective students: I am always actively looking for self-motivated PhD students to conduct research in socially responsible AI (fairness, interpretability/explainability, privacy, robustness, uncertainty quantification), causal machine learning, and data mining in general. I'm also happy to work with masters and undergraduate students. Interested students please email me with your CV and transcript(s).**
